```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Set the path to files and call libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
path = 'Q:/My Drive/Teo and landrace/Landrace/Diallel/'
```

Read in phenotype data set also used for GWAS, variance component estimation, etc.
We need to add some dummy variables to code for cross combinations, reciprocals, etc. to allow for diallel analysis
```{r}
LR = read.csv('Q:/My Drive/Teo and landrace/Landrace/HPC/Landraces_FL1314_all_data_updated_4398taxa_Fest_2.csv', stringsAsFactors = F) %>%
  mutate(v = Mother <= Father,
         com = ifelse(v, paste0(Mother, "x", Father), paste0(Father, "x", Mother)),
         #dr = a dummy variable to distinguish reciprocal crosses if combin is fit as model
         dr = ifelse(v, 1, -1),
         #TypeYear combines type and year so we can specify unique variances for all four combinations
         TypeYear = paste0(Type, Year)) %>%
  select(-v) 
```

Write to new file to use for diallel analysis
```{r}
write.csv(LR, file = paste0(path, 'Landraces_FL1314_all_data_updated_4398taxa_for_diallel.csv'), row.names = F, quote = F)
```
